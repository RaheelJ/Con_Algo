# Control Algorithms
This repository contains design and implementation of following control algorithms:
1. Adaptive model identification of a separately excited DC motor
2. Classical (Root-Locus based) position control of magnetic levitation system
3. Digital position control of DC motor using hardware-in-the-loop simulation
4. Robust H-infinity control for stabilizing single machine infinite bus bar system
5. Robust H-infinity control for reducing gust load of NASA generic transport model
