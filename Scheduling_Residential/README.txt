# Implementation of Paper "Optimal Operation of Residential Energy Hubs in Smart Grids"

To run the program, use the following steps:

1. Run Parameters.m 
2. Run Initialization.m
3. Run Main.m
4. Run Results

I have provided separate files for each case and properly inserted the comments in the files. So, you can change any 
parameter as you like. Also I have mentioned if anything extra is required for modification. I have done the best I could. 
You can make modifications as you want to improve the results.

For a research project, it is always good to also simulate the technique to which the results are compared because there
can be problems in finding the exact parameters. By using the same parameters for both, comparison at equal level can 
be made.

Thanks!
